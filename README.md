# Paul_Scholes_Fan_Page_HTML_CSS_Javascript
My first attempt at making a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Works best on Codepen

This code creates a web page dedicated to Paul Scholes, a legendary English football midfielder. The HTML structure includes sections for home, description, stats, media, and a form to ask Scholes questions. There is a navigation bar with links to these sections, and the main content showcases Scholes' career, achievements, and multimedia elements like images and videos.

The page includes buttons for accessibility features like toggling high contrast, increasing/decreasing text size, and showing/hiding images. JavaScript is used to create and remove a dynamic form for submitting questions, manage user preferences (theme and text size), and toggle image visibility. CSS styles the page, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility across devices, with support for dark mode and adjustable text sizes.
